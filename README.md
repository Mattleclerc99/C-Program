Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. For our first project, we had to develop a clock that the user could modify the Hours, minutes, and seconds and
by the input, the clock would modify it's time. The initial time would take the Local timezones time as well as displaying it in both 12-hour and 24-hour time.

What did you do particularly well? I thought I was able to sucessfully create a program that didn't result in errors and completed the tasked asked upon us in the guidelines.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
To enhance the code, I believe I could add more comments to make it more user friendly for whomever looks at my code in the future, they would be able to understand it better
or be able to make changes to enhance it.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? I thought learning
loops was the most difficult and how to not get in an infinite loop was the trickiest thing for me. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? I believe the if / else statements can be used for any other project as it is a very common
statement to use in code and is used frequently.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? By adding comments, adding multiple sources to communicate with one another, and "clean" code writing, this will
allow users to easily adapt into my program for ease of access and the ability to maintain it into the future without having to re-write the entire project. Having clean, easy to follow
code makes it more professional and what every programmer should practice.
